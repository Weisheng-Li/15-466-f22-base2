# Moon Craters == Rabbit Holes!

Author: Weisheng Li

Design: The game is inspired by a traditional Chinese festival, which is all about moon and rabbits. I try to emulate the exitement of barely dodging something fast and dangerous. In this game, you control a flying car that keeps getting faster. You need to steer this untamable vihecle to dodge the attacks from giant alien rabbits.
